Right: How an assembly of microscopic current loops add together to produce a macroscopically circulating current loop. Inside the boundaries, the individual contributions tend to cancel, but at the boundaries no cancelation occurs.\\nWhen an electric field is applied to a dielectric material its molecules respond by forming microscopic electric dipoles – their atomic nuclei move a tiny distance in the direction of the field, while their electrons move a tiny distance in the opposite direction. This produces a macroscopic bound charge in the material even though all of the charges involved are bound to individual molecules. For example, if every molecule responds the same, similar to that shown in the figure, these tiny movements of charge combine to produce a layer of positive bound charge on one side of the material and a layer of negative charge on the other side. The bound charge is most conveniently described in terms of the polarization P of the material, its dipole moment per unit volume. If P is uniform, a macroscopic separation of charge is produced only at the surfaces where P enters and leaves the material. For non-uniform P, a charge is also produced in the bulk.[13]\\nSomewhat similarly, in all materials the constituent atoms exhibit magnetic moments that are intrinsically linked to the angular momentum of the components of the atoms, most notably their electrons.

In general D and H depend on both E and B, on location and time, and possibly other physical quantities.\\nIn applications one also has to describe how the free currents and charge density behave in terms of E and B possibly coupled to other physical quantities like pressure, and the mass, number density, and velocity of charge-carrying particles.

Potentials were introduced as a convenient way to solve the homogeneous equations, but it was thought that all observable physics was contained in the electric and magnetic fields (or relativistically, the Faraday tensor). The potentials play a central role in quantum mechanics, however, and act quantum mechanically with observable consequences even when the electric and magnetic fields vanish (Aharonov–Bohm effect).\\nEach table describes one formalism.

This reduces the four Maxwell equations to two, which simplifies the equations, although we can no longer use the familiar vector formulation. Maxwell equations in formulation that do not treat space and time manifestly on the same footing have Lorentz invariance as a hidden symmetry. This was a major source of inspiration for the development of relativity theory. Indeed, even the formulation that treats space and time separately is not a non-relativistic approximation and describes the same physics by simply renaming variables. For this reason the relativistic invariant equations are usually called the Maxwell equations as well.\\nEach table below describes one formalism.

       "  'sentence_chunk': 'Solutions[edit]\\nMaxwell\\'s equations are partial differential equations that relate the electric and magnetic fields to each other and to the electric charges and currents. Often, the charges and currents are themselves dependent on the electric and magnetic fields via the Lorentz force equation and the constitutive relations. These all form a set of coupled partial differential equations which are often very difficult to solve: the solutions encompass all the diverse phenomena of classical electromagnetism. Some general remarks follow.\\nAs for any differential equation, boundary conditions[19][20][21] and initial conditions[22] are necessary for a unique solution. For example, even with no charges and no currents anywhere in spacetime, there are the obvious solutions for which E and B are zero or constant, but there are also non-trivial solutions corresponding to electromagnetic waves. In some cases, Maxwell\\'s equations are solved over the whole of space, and boundary conditions are given as asymptotic limits at infinity.[23] In other cases, Maxwell\\'s equations are solved in a finite region of space, with appropriate conditions on the boundary of that region, for example an artificial absorbing boundary representing the rest of the universe,[24][25] or periodic boundary conditions, or walls that isolate a small region from the outside world (as with a waveguide or cavity resonator).[26]\\nJefimenko\\'s equations (or the closely related Liénard–Wiechert potentials) are the explicit solution to Maxwell\\'s equations for the electric and magnetic fields created by any given distribution of charges and currents. It assumes specific initial conditions to obtain the so-called \"retarded solution\", where the only fields present are the ones created by the charges. However, Jefimenko\\'s equations are unhelpful in situations when the charges and currents are themselves affected by the fields they create.\\nNumerical methods for differential equations can be used to compute approximate solutions of Maxwell\\'s equations when exact solutions are impossible.',\n",

(The currents and charges are not unknowns, being freely specifiable subject to charge conservation.)This is related to a certain limited kind of redundancy in Maxwell's equations: It can be proven that any system satisfying Faraday's law and Ampère's circuital law automatically also satisfies the two Gauss's laws, as long as the system's initial condition does, and assuming conservation of charge and the nonexistence of magnetic monopoles.[30][31] \\nThis explanation was first introduced by Julius Adams Stratton in 1941.[32]\\nAlthough it is possible to simply ignore the two Gauss's laws in a numerical algorithm (apart from the initial conditions), the imperfect precision of the calculations can lead to ever-increasing violations of those laws. By introducing dummy variables characterizing these violations, the four equations become not overdetermined after all. The resulting formulation can lead to more accurate algorithms that take all four laws into account.[33]\\nBoth identities \\n\\n\\n\\n∇\\n⋅\\n∇\\n×\\n\\nB\\n\\n≡\\n0\\n,\\n∇\\n⋅\\n∇\\n×\\n\\nE\\n\\n≡\\n0\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle \\\\nabla \\\\cdot \\\\nabla \\\\times \\\\mathbf {B} \\\\equiv 0,\\\\nabla \\\\cdot \\\\nabla \\\\times \\\\mathbf {E} \\\\equiv 0}\\n\\n, which reduce eight equations to six independent ones, are the true reason of overdetermination.[34][35]\\nEquivalently, the overdetermination can be viewed as implying conservation of electric and magnetic charge, as they are required in the derivation described above but implied by the two Gauss's laws.\\nFor linear algebraic equations, one can make 'nice' rules to rewrite the equations and unknowns. The equations can be linearly dependent. But in differential equations, and especially partial differential equations (PDEs), one needs appropriate boundary conditions, which depend in not so obvious ways on the equations. Even more, if one rewrites them in terms of vector and scalar potential, then the equations are underdetermined because of gauge fixing.\",\n",

However they do not account for quantum effects and so their domain of applicability is limited. Maxwell\\'s equations are thought of as the classical limit of quantum electrodynamics (QED).\\nSome observed electromagnetic phenomena are incompatible with Maxwell\\'s equations. These include photon–photon scattering and many other phenomena related to photons or virtual photons, \"nonclassical light\" and quantum entanglement of electromagnetic fields (see Quantum optics). E.g. quantum cryptography cannot be described by Maxwell theory, not even approximately. The approximate nature of Maxwell\\'s equations becomes more and more apparent when going into the extremely strong field regime (see Euler–Heisenberg Lagrangian) or to extremely small distances.\\nFinally, Maxwell\\'s equations cannot explain any phenomenon involving individual photons interacting with quantum matter, such as the photoelectric effect, Planck\\'s law, the Duane–Hunt law, and single-photon light detectors. However, many such phenomena may be approximated using a halfway theory of quantum matter coupled to a classical electromagnetic field, either as external field or with the expected value of the charge current and density on the right hand side of Maxwell\\'s equations.\\n\\nVariations[edit]\\nPopular variations on the Maxwell equations as a classical theory of electromagnetic fields are relatively scarce because the standard equations have stood the test of time remarkably well.',\n",

      "The equations provide a mathematical model for electric, optical, and radio technologies, such as power generation, electric motors, wireless communication, lenses, radar, etc. They describe how electric and magnetic fields are generated by charges, currents, and changes of the fields.[note 1] The equations are named after the physicist and mathematician James Clerk Maxwell, who, in 1861 and 1862, published an early form of the equations that included the Lorentz force law. Maxwell first used the equations to propose that light is an electromagnetic phenomenon. The modern form of the equations in their most common formulation is credited to Oliver Heaviside.[1]\n",

With a corresponding change in the values of the quantities for the Lorentz force law this yields the same physics, i.e. trajectories of charged particles, or work done by an electric motor. These definitions are often preferred in theoretical and high energy physics where it is natural to take the electric and magnetic field with the same units, to simplify the appearance of the electromagnetic tensor: the Lorentz covariant object unifying electric and magnetic field would then contain components with uniform unit and dimension.[9]: vii Such modified definitions are conventionally used with the Gaussian (CGS) units.\n",

This perpetual cycle allows these waves, now known as electromagnetic radiation, to move through space at velocity c. Macroscopic formulation[edit]\n",
      "The above equations are the microscopic version of Maxwell's equations, expressing the electric and the magnetic fields in terms of the (possibly atomic-level) charges and currents present. This is sometimes called the \"general\" form, but the macroscopic version below is equally general, the difference being one of bookkeeping.\n",
      "The microscopic version is sometimes called \"Maxwell's equations in vacuum\": this refers to the fact that the material medium is not built into the structure of the equations, but appears only in the charge and current terms. The microscopic version was introduced by Lorentz, who tried to use it to derive the macroscopic properties of bulk matter from its microscopic constituents.[12]: 5 \"Maxwell's macroscopic equations\", also known as Maxwell's equations in matter, are more similar to those that Maxwell introduced himself. This reflects a splitting of the total electric charge Q and current I (and their densities ρ and J) into free and bound parts: Q = Q f + Q b = ∭ Ω ( ρ f + ρ b ) d V\n",

      "The very complicated and granular bound charges and bound currents, therefore, can be represented on the macroscopic scale in terms of P and M, which average these charges and currents on a sufficiently large scale so as not to see the granularity of individual atoms, but also sufficiently small that they vary with location in the material.

Constitutive relations[edit]\n",
      "Main article: Constitutive equation § Electromagnetism\n",
      "In order to apply 'Maxwell's macroscopic equations', it is necessary to specify the relations between displacement field D and the electric field E, as well as the magnetizing field H and the magnetic field B. Equivalently, we have to specify the dependence of the polarization P (hence the bound charge) and the magnetization M (hence the bound current) on the applied electric and magnetic field. The equations specifying this response are called constitutive relations. For real-world materials, the constitutive relations are rarely simple, except approximately, and usually determined by experiment. See the main article on constitutive relations for a fuller description.[15]: 44–45 For materials without polarization and magnetization, the constitutive relations are (by definition)[9]: 2 D = ε 0 E , H = 1 μ 0 B , {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {D} =\\varepsilon _{0}\\mathbf {E} ,\\quad \\mathbf {H} ={\\frac {1}{\\mu _{0}}}\\mathbf {B} ,} where ε0 is the permittivity of free space and μ0 the permeability of free space.\n",
      "577.0\n",
      "Since there is no bound charge, the total and the free charge and current are equal.\n",
      "An alternative viewpoint on the microscopic equations is that they are the macroscopic equations together with the statement that vacuum behaves like a perfect linear \"material\" without additional polarization and magnetization.\n",
      "More generally, for linear materials the constitutive relations are[15]: 44–45 D =\n",
      "ε E , H = 1\n",
      "μ B , {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {D} =\\varepsilon \\mathbf {E} ,\\quad \\mathbf {H} ={\\frac {1}{\\mu }}\\mathbf {B} ,} where ε is the permittivity and μ the permeability of the material. For the displacement field D the linear approximation is usually excellent because for all but the most extreme electric fields or temperatures obtainable in the laboratory (high power pulsed lasers) the interatomic electric fields of materials of the order of 1011 V/m are much higher than the external field. For the magnetizing field H {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {H} } , however, the linear approximation can break down in common materials like iron leading to phenomena like hysteresis. Even the linear case can have various complications, however. For homogeneous materials, ε and μ are constant throughout the material, while for inhomogeneous materials they depend on location within the material (and perhaps time).[16]: 463 For isotropic materials, ε and μ are scalars, while for anisotropic materials (e.g. due to crystal structure) they are tensors.[15]: 421 [16]: 463 Materials are generally dispersive, so ε and μ depend on the frequency of any incident EM waves.[15]: 625 [16]: 397 Even more generally, in the case of non-linear materials (see for example nonlinear optics), D and P are not necessarily proportional to E, similarly H or M is not necessarily proportional to B. In general D and H depend on both E and B, on location and time, and possibly other physical quantities.\n",
      "In applications one also has to describe how the free currents and charge density behave in terms of E and B possibly coupled to other physical quantities like pressure, and the mass, number density, and velocity of charge-carrying particles.

      "Maxwell's equations seem overdetermined, in that they involve six unknowns (the three components of E and B) but eight equations (one for each of the two Gauss's laws, three vector components each for Faraday's and Ampère's circuital laws). (The currents and charges are not unknowns, being freely specifiable subject to charge conservation.)This is related to a certain limited kind of redundancy in Maxwell's equations: It can be proven that any system satisfying Faraday's law and Ampère's circuital law automatically also satisfies the two Gauss's laws, as long as the system's initial condition does, and assuming conservation of charge and the nonexistence of magnetic monopoles.[30][31] This explanation was first introduced by Julius Adams Stratton in 1941.[32]\n",
      "Although it is possible to simply ignore the two Gauss's laws in a numerical algorithm (apart from the initial conditions), the imperfect precision of the calculations can lead to ever-increasing violations of those laws. By introducing dummy variables characterizing these violations, the four equations become not overdetermined after all. The resulting formulation can lead to more accurate algorithms that take all four laws into account.[33]\n",

      "Equivalently, the overdetermination can be viewed as implying conservation of electric and magnetic charge, as they are required in the derivation described above but implied by the two Gauss's laws.\n",
      "For linear algebraic equations, one can make 'nice' rules to rewrite the equations and unknowns. The equations can be linearly dependent. But in differential equations, and especially partial differential equations (PDEs), one needs appropriate boundary conditions, which depend in not so obvious ways on the equations. Even more, if one rewrites them in terms of vector and scalar potential, then the equations are underdetermined because of gauge fixing.\n",

      "The publication of the equations marked the unification of a theory for previously separately described phenomena: magnetism, electricity, light, and associated radiation.\n",
      "Since the mid-20th century, it has been understood that Maxwell's equations do not give an exact description of electromagnetic phenomena, but are instead a classical limit of the more precise theory of quantum electrodynamics.\n",

      "Gauss's law describes the relationship between an electric field and electric charges: an electric field points away from positive charges and towards negative charges, and the net outflow of the electric field through a closed surface is proportional to the enclosed charge, including bound charge due to polarization of material. The coefficient of the proportion is the permittivity of free space.\n",
